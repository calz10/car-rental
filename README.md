# Car Rental
Please note that his is testable only in ios. No time for configuring in android. Though I have already copy and pasted the instructions that are necessary 
To make it work in android.

**Installation**

- After downloading the repository, run `npm install or yarn install` in the folder.
  - If encountered issues in installation, you may try to delete the yarn.lock or package-lock.json and retry installing again
- If you're using MAC, you need to double check if pod has installed otherwise just do npx pod-install and this will install the pod file dependencies
  - If encountered an issue you may try,
    - cd ios
    - pod deintegrate
    - rm Podfile.lock
    - pod install
